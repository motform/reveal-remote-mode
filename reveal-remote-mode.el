;;; Commentary:

;; A simple remote control for Reveal.
;; Currently requires CIDER and a pre-configured nrepl connection,
;; but my goal is to make this agnostic/usable with most repl connections.

;;; Code:

(require 'cider)

;;; Customization

(defgroup reveal-remote nil
  "Reveal-remote functions and settings."
  :group  'tools
  :prefix "reveal-remote-")

(defcustom reveal-remote-mode-keymap-prefix (kbd "C-c C-a")
  "Reveal-remote keymap prefix."
  :group 'reveal-remote
  :type  'string)


;;; Internal:

(defun reveal-remote--submit-command (command)
  "Submit map with key `:vlaaad.reveal/command' and COMMAND as val."
  (let ((form (format "{:vlaaad.reveal/command %s}" command)))
    (when (not (cider-interactive-eval form)) ; cider-interactive-eval returns nils on fail
      (message "Unable to send form. Are you sure you are connected to an nrepl through CIDER in this buffer?"))))

;;; Interactive:

(defun reveal-remote-clear ()
  "Clear the Reveal window."
  (interactive)
  (reveal-remote--submit-command "'(clear-output)"))

(defun reveal-remote-dispose ()
  "Disposes the Reveal window."
  (interactive)
  (when (y-or-n-p "Are you sure you want to dispose of the Reval window? ")
    (reveal-remote--submit-command "'(dispose)")))

(defun reveal-remote-submit ()
  "Submit value at point to output panel.
Ignores, and thus prints, data that might be a valid reveal command map.

NOTE, unless :env is set forms will be evaluated in the `vlaaad.reveal.ext',
NOT the namespace of the buffer."
  (interactive)
  (reveal-remote--submit-command
   (format "'(submit %s)" (cider-last-sexp))))

;;; Minor Mode:

(defvar reveal-remote-command-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "l") #'reveal-remote-clear)
    (define-key map (kbd "q") #'reveal-remote-dispose)
    (define-key map (kbd "e") #'reveal-remote-submit)
    map)
  "Keymap for reveal-remote-mode commands after `reveal-remote-mode-keymap-prefix'.")
(fset 'reval-remote-command-map reveal-remote-command-map)

(defvar reveal-remote-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map reveal-remote-mode-keymap-prefix 'reveal-remote-command-map)
    map)
  "Keymap for reveal-remote-mode.")
