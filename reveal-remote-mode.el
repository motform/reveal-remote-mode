;;; Commentary:

;; A simple remote control for Reveal.
;; Currently requires CIDER and a pre-configured nrepl connection,
;; but my goal is to make this agnostic/usable with most repl connections.

;;; Code:

(require 'cider-eval)

;;; Customization
(defgroup reveal-remote nil
  "Reveal-remote functions and settings."
  :group 'tools
  :prefix "reveal-remote-")

(defcustom reveal-remote-mode-keymap-prefix (kbd "C-c C-r")
  "Reveal-remote keymap prefix."
  :group 'reveal-remote
  :type 'string)

;;; Internal:

(defun reveal-remote--submit-command (command)
  "Submit contents COMMAND as val to a `:vlaaad.reveal/command' map."
  (cider-interactive-eval ; how do we make sure this is in the correct env?
   (format "{:vlaaad.reveal/command %s}" command)))

;;; Interactive:

(defun reveal-remote-clear ()
  "Clear the Reveal window."
  (interactive)
  (when (not (reveal-remote--submit-command "'(clear-output)"))
    (message "Unable to send form. Are you sure you are connected to an nrepl through CIDER in this buffer?")))

(defun reveal-remote-dispose ()
  "Disposes the Reveal window."
  (interactive)
  (when (y-or-n-p "Are you sure you want to dispose of the Reveal window? ")
    (reveal-remote--submit-command "'(dispose)")))

;;; Minor Mode:

(defvar reveal-remote-command-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "l") #'reveal-remote-clear)
    map)
  "Keymap for reveal-remote-mode commands after `reveal-remote-mode-keymap-prefix'.")
(fset 'reval-remote-command-map reveal-remote-command-map)

(defvar reveal-remote-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map reveal-remote-mode-keymap-prefix 'reveal-remote-command-map)
    map)
  "Keymap for reveal-remote-mode.")

;;;###autoload
